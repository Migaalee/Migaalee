I am inter-disciplinary scientist with a strong educational foundation, including a BSc in Bioengineering, a PhD in Life Sciences and MSc degree in Big Data Engineering (Data Science). I specialize in complex data analysis in multi-omics (bioinformatics), machine learning, and drug discovery. I enjoy keeping a fast pace with evolving requirements of the data science and healthcare sectors.
